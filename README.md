# updatepsu
Install, Refresh, and/or Update to the latest version of PlaneShift Unreal for Linux.

Useful for when official updater cannot be used, full release update is required, or to "refresh" a broken install.

# Features
- Always downloads the latest published full package
- Checks if already downloaded, skips if true
- Allows user to specify install and download directory (Optional)
- Checks for existance of install and download directory, creates them if missing
- Checks if install directory is empty, user confirmation if not empty
- User confirmation before clearing directory (refresh install)
- Prunes root dir from package, that way we always extract to same install folder (useful for maintaining shortcuts across upgrades and avoiding multiple installs)

# Planned
- Add logic to check if user has latest version applied and skip install
-Add option to override install skip when latest version already installed, in order to force "refresh" install
- Add option to perform overwrite install, rather than "refresh" install (maybe not nessecaery since configs live elsewhere)
- Verify checksum up downloaded file

# Requirements
- Install lynx package

# Reccomended Usage
You can run this from anywhere, it will always download and install to the specified locations.

I prefer to use it like this:
- Clone and copy to your ~/bin or other $PATH and run 'updatepsu' from any terminal, anywhere
- Remember to 'sudo chmod +x ~/bin/updatepsu'
